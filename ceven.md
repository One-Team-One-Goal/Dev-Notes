# To Do & Progress Log

## August 13, 2025 — Planned
- [x] Connect frontend and backend
- [x] Find GitHub APIs for Boolean algebra solver
- [ ] Find GitHub APIs for Karnaugh maps solver
- [ ] Find GitHub APIs for Logicly-like tool

## August 13, 2025 — Completed
- Refactored auth (made flows cleaner and less strict for non-critical features)
- Added Fastify on backend + token checking
- Added frontend service + API + constants

## August 17, 2025 — Completed
- [x] Finished backend API endpoint for Boolean calculator simplifier (simplify-only)

## Next Up
- Align simplifier steps formatting with original algorithm labels (DM, DNEG, DIST)
- Decide on K-Map solver source and integration approach
- Define list of non-critical features allowed for guest users
