# Usability Testing Plan: Bitwise

## 1. Methodology
We will utilize a mixed-method approach combining **Task-Based Usability Testing** (to measure effectiveness and efficiency) and the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** (to measure satisfaction).

## 2. Test Demographics
*   **Target Audience:** Students / Peers
*   **Sample Size:** 5-10 users (Standard for identifying 80% of usability problems)

## 3. Test Script (The Tasks)
*Instructions to User: "Please perform the following tasks while speaking your thoughts aloud. Do not worry about making mistakes; we are testing the system, not you."*

| Task ID | Task Name | Scenario / Instruction | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T01** | **Onboarding** | "Register a new account and log in to the dashboard." | User lands on the dashboard/roadmap page. |
| **T02** | **Learning** | "Navigate to the 'Lessons' section and start the first lesson." | User successfully opens a lesson content page. |
| **T03** | **Tools** | "Use the Calculator or Converter tool to solve a binary problem." | User inputs data and receives a correct result. |
| **T04** | **Visualization** | "Open the Karnaugh Map tool and interact with the grid." | User successfully toggles a cell or generates an expression. |
| **T05** | **Assessment** | "Take a short assessment or quiz." | User submits the quiz and sees their result/feedback. |

## 4. Post-Test Survey (The Form)

### Part A: System Usability Scale (SUS)
*Rate the following statements on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)*

1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.
3. I thought the system was easy to use.
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.
9. I felt very confident using the system.
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

### Part B: Educational Value (Simplified TAM)
*Rate on a scale of 1 to 5*

11. Using Bitwise helps me understand computer architecture concepts better.
12. The interactive tools (K-Map, Calculator) made learning easier than traditional methods.

### Part C: Open-Ended Feedback
13. What was the most difficult part of using the application?
14. What feature did you find most helpful?
15. Do you have any suggestions for improvement?

## 5. Metrics to Record
*   **Completion Rate:** % of users who finished the task without help.
*   **SUS Score:** Calculate using the standard formula (Score * 2.5).
*   **Adjective Rating:** Convert SUS score to adjective (e.g., >80 = "Excellent").
